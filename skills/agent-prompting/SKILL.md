  Write, review and version agent system prompts: structure, altitude, tool-use policy,
  output format, few-shot examples, structured outputs with validation, reasoning settings
  and per-model quirks. Use when the user writes or edits a system prompt, prompt template
  or examples; says "review my prompt", "the agent ignores my instructions", "JSON is
  invalid", "should I use CRITICAL / MUST", "turn this SOP into a prompt"; or re-tunes a
  prompt for a new model. Not for context over long runs or memory (agent-context),
  retrieval (agent-rag), tool schemas and descriptions (agent-tools), or the model
  migration process (agent-production).

# Agent prompting

Goal: fewer, clearer instructions that fix observed failures, versioned like code. Length
and emphasis are not goals.

## Core rules

1. **No prompt change ships without an eval run** before and after, with the delta in
   `experiment-log.md`. No eval → build one first (`agent-evals` → "Minimal eval"); ~20
   real cases is enough while effects are large.
2. **Start minimal on the strongest model.** Add a line only for a failure category seen
   in traces, never for one bad trace.
3. **Right altitude:** heuristics with reasons, not if/else trees and not platitudes. If a
   capable newcomer would be confused, the model will be too.
4. **Say what to do and why.** "Output is read aloud by TTS, so no ellipses" beats "NEVER
   use ellipses".
5. **No contradictions; at most one emphasised line.** "CRITICAL: You MUST" makes newer
   models over-trigger. Write "Use X when …".
6. **Must-always rules go in code** (schema, enum, hook, permission check). The prompt only
   explains them.
7. **Machine-read output uses structured outputs** and is still validated in code.
8. **Examples: 3–5 diverse, canonical cases**, never from the eval dev/test split.
9. **Prompts are files:** versioned, reviewed, and the version recorded on every trace.

## Workflow

1. **Gather.** Read `design.md`, `failure-taxonomy.md` and recent traces. Establish the
   model, the tools and who consumes the output (human, code, another agent). Ask the user
   for edge-case policy and tone.
2. **Baseline.** Run the eval on the current prompt and record the score.
3. **Structure** with the skeleton in `references/system-prompt-structure.md`.
4. **Tool policy.** Cross-tool "which tool when" and the action mode (act vs suggest) go in
   the prompt; per-tool detail goes in tool descriptions (`agent-tools`).
5. **Output.** If code reads it: schema, structured outputs or strict tools, validation
   with bounded retry (`references/examples-and-structured-output.md`).
6. **Reasoning.** Set thinking/effort natively. Prompt for planning only at low/minimal
   effort or for policy-heavy tool chains.
7. **Examples** only when format or borderline behaviour still fails after the
   instructions are clear.
8. **Model pass** with `references/model-quirks.md`.
9. **Prune** with `references/prompt-review-checklist.md`: delete any line whose removal
   wouldn't cause a mistake.
10. **Measure.** Re-run evals, check other categories for regressions, bump the prompt
    version, log change / hypothesis / delta / decision.
11. **Next.** Failures persist on a clean prompt → `agent-accuracy`. Long runs or
    multi-turn state → `agent-context`.

## Decision rules

| If | Then |
|---|---|
| Code parses the output | Structured outputs / strict tool schema, not "respond in JSON" prose. Validate anyway. |
| Classification or routing label | Enum in a schema or enum-typed tool argument, with an `other` value. |
| Format or style drifts | 3–5 diverse examples before more rules. |
| Agent ignores a rule | Look for a contradiction, vague altitude or buried position first. Must always hold → code. |
| Agent over-uses a tool or behaviour | Remove emphasis; state when to use it and when not. |
| SOP or policy doc is the spec | Numbered routine, one action per step, branches for missing information. |
| Prompt has grown nested if/else | Split: routing workflow, or one template with policy variables (`agent-design`). |
| Long documents (20K+ tokens) | Documents first, question last, each in `<document>` tags, "quote relevant passages first". |
| Reasoning needed | Native thinking/effort. A "think" tool only for policy-heavy sequential tool chains. |
| Switching models | Strip over-prompting, sweep effort fresh, re-run evals (`agent-production`). |
| One bad trace | Add it to the dataset; patch only when the category recurs. |

## Anti-patterns

- A laundry list of edge cases instead of a heuristic plus a few canonical examples.
- Prompt strings scattered through code and concatenated at runtime, so no one can say
  which prompt produced a trace.
- Tool schemas pasted into prompt text instead of the API `tools` field.
- Last-turn prefill to force JSON on Claude 4.6+ (returns 400).
- Asking for step-by-step reasoning inside tool arguments. Ask for "a short explanation".
- Running an automated prompt optimiser before the evals are trustworthy.
- Reusing a prompt tuned for one model family on another without re-running evals.

## Outputs

- Prompt files in the user's repo (e.g. `prompts/<agent>/system.md`), versioned and loaded
  by name.
- Prompt name and version on every LLM span (`gen_ai.prompt.name` / `.version`, or
  OpenInference `llm.prompt_template.version`); see `agent-observability`.
- One `experiment-log.md` entry per prompt change, with the eval delta.
